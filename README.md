# EuclideanMST
Implementations of different algorithms for building Euclidean minimum spanning tree in k-dimensional space.
### Algorithms:
  - EMST using Kd-tree O(NlogN)
  Implementation of algorithm described in "Fast Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree: Algorithm, Analysis, and Applications. William B. March, Parikshit Ram, Alexander G. Gray"
  - Prim's algorithm O(N^2)
    Straightforward MST on fully connected Eclidean graph

### TODO:
- Implement EMST using Cover-tree
- Benchmarks
- \dots
